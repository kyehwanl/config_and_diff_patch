    I am frequently connecting to several servers over SSH at once and like to use tmux to organize those 
    different sessions. To be able to keep track which pane is which server I am using the following function 
    in my .bashrc file to display the machine name in tmuxâ€™s pane title.


    * use this code into .bashrc

    ssh() {
        if [ "$(ps -p $(ps -p $$ -o ppid=) -o comm=)" = "tmux" ]; then
            tmux rename-window "$(echo $* | cut -d . -f 1)"
            command ssh "$@"
            tmux set-window-option automatic-rename "on" 1>/dev/null
        else
            command ssh "$@"
        fi
    }

(3) test result
    - it was successful to change a window-status title, but if you apply this, you re not going to customize the title any more
