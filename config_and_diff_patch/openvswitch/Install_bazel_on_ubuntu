Using Bazel custom APT repository
  Step 1: Install the JDK
    Install JDK 8:

    sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk
    On Ubuntu 14.04 LTS you must use a PPA:

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:webupd8team/java
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install oracle-java8-installer

  Step 2: Add Bazel distribution URI as a package source
     Note: This is a one-time setup step.

    echo "deb [arch=amd64] http://storage.googleapis.com/bazel-apt stable jdk1.8" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/bazel.list
    curl https://bazel.build/bazel-release.pub.gpg | sudo apt-key add -
    If you want to install the testing version of Bazel, replace stable with testing.

  Step 3: Install and update Bazel
    sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install bazel
    Once installed, you can upgrade to a newer version of Bazel with the following command:

    sudo apt-get install --only-upgrade bazel


Installing using binary installer
The binary installers are on Bazel’s GitHub releases page.

The installer contains the Bazel binary. Some additional libraries must also be installed for Bazel to work.

  Step 1: Install required packages
  First, install the prerequisites: pkg-config, zip, g++, zlib1g-dev, unzip, and python.

  sudo apt-get install pkg-config zip g++ zlib1g-dev unzip python
  Step 2: Download Bazel
  Next, download the Bazel binary installer named bazel-<version>-installer-linux-x86_64.sh from the Bazel releases page on GitHub.

  Step 3: Run the installer
  Run the Bazel installer as follows:

  chmod +x bazel-<version>-installer-linux-x86_64.sh
  ./bazel-<version>-installer-linux-x86_64.sh --user
  The --user flag installs Bazel to the $HOME/bin directory on your system and sets the .bazelrc path to $HOME/.bazelrc. Use the --help command to see additional installation options.

  Step 4: Set up your environment
  If you ran the Bazel installer with the --user flag as above, the Bazel executable is installed in your $HOME/bin directory. It’s a good idea to add this directory to your default paths, as follows:

  export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/bin"
  You can also add this command to your ~/.bashrc file.
