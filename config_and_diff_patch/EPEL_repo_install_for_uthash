https://www.liquidweb.com/kb/enable-epel-repository/



1. What, Why EPEL repo

  The EPEL repository is an additional package repository that provides easy access to install packages for commonly used software. 
  This repo was created because Fedora contributors wanted to use Fedora packages they maintain on RHEL and other compatible distributions.
  To put it simply the goal of this repo was to provide greater ease of access to software on Enterprise Linux compatible distributions.

  The EPEL group creates, maintains and manages a high-quality set of additional packages. 
  These packages may be software not included in the core repository, or sometimes updates which havenâ€™t been provided yet.
