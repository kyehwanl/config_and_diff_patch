Macro Debugging Tip
===================


#1. you can expand c-source program which is using macro in it to the
expanded-c source program which could be made with gcc option -E, then
preprocessor expand source programs into the source without macro in place.

#2. if you use gcc option -g3 or -gdwarf-2 -g3 on any current gcc version, it
will be expanded and could see the macro definitions.


#3. gdb expansion in place,
on gdb running, you can always expand macro and debug with gdb command, 
(gdb) info macro <MACRO>
(gdb) macro expand <MACRO>
