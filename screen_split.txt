Creating a new region

Once you started screen, you will be able to create regions. To create a region, type:
C-a S
That is, typing a while holding the control key, then typing a capital S. The new region will be below the current shell session with no prompt it in.

Moving between regions

To start a new shell in the new region, we first need to move to it, or change the focus to the new region.
C-a TAB
That is, typing a while holding the control key, then pressing the tabulation key. The ¡°C-a TAB¡± sequence of commands allows us to move through all the created regions. If you do ¡°C-a TAB¡± again, you will move to the next region.

Creating a new shell

Once the new region has the focus, we create a new shell by typing
C-a c
That is, typing a while holding the control key, then typing c.
Now you should see the shell prompt in the new region.

Killing a region

If we want to kill a region, we just need to move to the region then type
C-a X
That is, typing a while holding the control key, then typing a capital x.
