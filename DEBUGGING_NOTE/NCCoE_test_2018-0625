NCCoE BGP RPKI TEST
===================

1. bgpsecio 
    - verion 0.2.0.24
    - traffic generator stops sending a bgp traffic on the number of 467,xxx packet at every time. 
    - collector side, it finishs receiving the update messages from the Juniper router
        -- the exact count varies
    - But when turning on print messages on console, it goes until end of update message received
        -- at around 120,000 packets
        -- comparing Quagga, it received almost same amount of packets with the number bgpsecio received
        

2. traffic generator using ExaBGP 3.4.9
    - able to parse mrt dump file, "701.updates", which bgpsecio normally uses





Measurement
============

1. BGP Convergence with 700,000 updates from the peer (192.168.1.51)
    - measure from Quagga, 
        -- 90 seconds

    - measure from bgpsecio with printout option 
        -- 145 seconds




2. at some point, Juniper router increases the amount of sending 8000 packet at each time, then bgpsecio seems to shutdown when dealing with these exponentially increased amount of packets
