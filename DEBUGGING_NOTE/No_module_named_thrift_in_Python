No module named thrift in Python script
=======================================

(cause)
python3 basically isn't compatible with thrift 

(solution)
1. download thrift version with git in https://thrift.apache.org/download
2. go to the directory "lib/py" in thrift
3. hit the command "python3 setup.py install"
