Prerequisites
To manually build Buck, download and install the following prerequisites:

  Oracle Java Development Kit version 8 (support for future versions is in the works)
  Apache Ant 1.9 (or newer)
  Python 2.7
  Git
  Watchman
      With watchman, Buck will use a daemon which will prevent Buck from parsing all of your build 
      files every time and cache some other things as well. It is strongly recommended that you install Watchman.



   You can use your distro's package manager (e.g., apt) to install many of the prerequisites on Linux. For example on Ubuntu 16.04, you can run the following:


  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install default-jdk ant python2 git
  # install watchman as stated in the watchman prerequisite link above



Build
Once you have the above tools installed, you can build Buck as follows:

  git clone https://github.com/facebook/buck.git
  cd buck
  ant
  ./bin/buck build --show-output buck
  buck-out/gen/programs/buck.pex --help
