================================


1. siruen

    < error >
   package github.com/sirupsen/logrus/examples/hook: case-insensitive import collision: "github.com/Sirupsen/logrus" and "github.com/sirupsen/logrus"

    < cause >
    

    < solution>
    copy Sirupsen from vmware-005 to the destination folder



2. idac.server02-antd [1319]{.../gobgp/gobgpd}-> go build  ./...
    # github.com/osrg/gobgp/tab
    /table/path.go:340:37: multiple-value uuid.NewV4() in single-value context


    <cause>
    https://github.com/hlandau/acmetool/issues/293
    This issue is due to an upstream API change in the github.com/satori/go.uuid package, 
    specifically the change for satori/go.uuid#18. A number of people have raised issues against go.uuid 
    about this being a breaking API change, so there's a chance that it will be reverted at some point.

    (It's possible to work around this to build Acme with a small code change, or in go.uuid by checking 
    out a version before this breaking API change.) 
    
    <solution>
    id,_ := uuid.NewV4()

    --> 340     path.OriginInfo().uuid, _ = uuid.NewV4()
