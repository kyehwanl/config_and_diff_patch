gRPC enabled qsrx and srx server
=================================

1. in go-grpc, stream is not thread safe
 (cf) https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/grpc-io/aI6L6M4fzQ0

 - tried to use worker pool to generate multiple go-routines, but it happened 
    that the stream object was shared among go-routines and resulting in recv() and any other 
    functions were shared. Totally messed.
