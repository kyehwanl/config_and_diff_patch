2. NSS problem 

 <description>
 - this causes git clone and curl from patching jobs
 - need to find a solution


 <Cause>
 - Stale NSS version and some sites donot support redhat's old version of NSS


 <Solved partially>
 - Just rename /etc/pki/nssdb --> /etc/pki/nssdb_bkup on vmware-005
    and then, it works as normal 

    OR more easily,

 - Just ONLY change pkcs11.txt's filename in nssdb into pkcs11.txt.bkup, then it works
    
    I guess the root cause of this issue might be this file, pkcs11.txt


 - Important Fact
    (source: https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/280548/curl-doesnt-connect-to-https-while-wget-does-nss-error-12286)

    * Need to update NSS
    * Relevant: www-archive.mozilla.org/projects/security/pki/nss/ref/ssl/â€¦ where it says that NSS error -12286 means 
      SSL_ERROR_NO_CYPHER_OVERLAP "Cannot communicate securely with peer: no common encryption algorithm(s)." 
      The local and remote systems share no cipher suites in common. This can be due to a misconfiguration at either end. 
      It can be due to a server being misconfigured to use a non-RSA certificate with the RSA key exchange algorithm
