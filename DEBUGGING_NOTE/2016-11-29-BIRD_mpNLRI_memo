BIRD MP NLRI test note
======================

1.Withdrawal Message Comparison 

 * BIRD: Unfeasible Route Length filed + Withdrawn Route + MP_UNREACH_NLRI (Path attribute)
 * QSRX: Unfeasible Route Length filed + Withdrawn Route


 That means, QSRX doesn't implement MP_UNREACH_NLRI 

 * Confimred that if BIRD stopped by keyboard interrupt (hitting Ctrl+C), 
    BIRD doesn't generate a withdrawal message at all.



2. TEST

 * purpose: to see if the 3rd node could eliminate the stored prefix info when it receives a withdrawal message.
    A. first, feed a prefix from the 1st node and send it to the 2nd and then to the last 3rd.
    B. By terminating a routing process on the 1st node to generate a withdrawal message.
    C. Observing on the 3rd node to confirm whether the previous stored prefix is removed or not.

 * experiment topology

    (1) BIRD -- BIRD -- BIRD
    (2) QSRX -- BIRD -- QSRX

 * Result
    (1) 3rd node (BIRD) didn't get rid of the stored prefix
    (2) 3rd node (QSRX) removed its stored prefix



3. Final Result 

 * 1st node BIRD - not generate a notification when the connection shut off

 * 2nd node BIRD - 2 cases, 
    A. connection loss detected, generate a withdrawal with MP_UNREACH_NLRI
    B. got a notification (when using QSRx as 1st node), generate a withdrawal with MP_UNREACH_NLRI
    C. Other problem: if 2nd node BIRD stored 10 prefixes, for example, 
        it only sends one withdrawal(a first listed prefix) to the peer

 * 3rd node BIRD - ignores a withdrawal with MP_UNREACH_NLRI in BIRD's receive update procedure.



4. Additionals 

 * BIRD's withdrawal in case multiple prefixes, it made one general(legacy) prefix for withdrawal
   and multiple MP_UNREACH_NLRI messages
